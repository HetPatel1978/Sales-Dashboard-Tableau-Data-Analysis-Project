I designed and developed a dynamic Sales Dashboard using Tableau to analyze and visualize four years of sales data. Here’s what I accomplished:

• Data Preparation: Cleaned and organized raw sales data for seamless integration into Tableau.

• Dashboard Design: Created an interactive, user-friendly dashboard with a focus on aesthetics and functionality.

• Visual Insights:
-Showcased total sales, year-over-year growth, and profit trends.
-Highlighted performance across product sub-categories and monthly trends.

• Dynamic Filters: Enabled filtering by year, product categories, sub-categories, and geographic 
  locations (region, state, city) to make the dashboard adaptable to user needs.

• Storytelling with Data: Transformed raw data into actionable insights, helping stakeholders identify 
  high-performing areas and improvement opportunities.

• Business Impact: Delivered a tool that empowers decision-making by providing clear, data-driven 
  insights.

This project highlights my skills in data visualization, storytelling, and creating solutions that simplify complex datasets into valuable insights for stakeholders.
